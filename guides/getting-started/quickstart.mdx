The Keyframe API and SDKs provide simple interfaces for adding personas to AI agents and applications. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a minimal example of a persona that works with your favorite agent or LLM. By the end, you’ll have a working persona that you can video call with in your web browser.

## Prerequisites

- [Sign up](platform.keyframelabs.com) to the Keyframe Labs platform and [create a new API key](/guides/getting-started/get-your-api-key)
- ElevenLabs, Cartesia, or Google Cloud (Gemini), to serve as your agent or LLM

### Prepare your agent or LLM provider details

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cartesia Line">
    To use Cartesia Line as your agent provider, you'll need:

    - The agent ID from Cartesia of the agent you wish to use
    - [An access token from Cartesia with appropriate agent grants](https://docs.cartesia.ai/get-started/authenticate-your-client-applications)

    And then we'll use this snippet in the steps to follow:

    ```typescript
    type VoiceAgentDetails = {
      type: 'cartesia';
      agent_id?: '<your_cartesia_agent_id>;
      token?: '<your_cartesia_access_token>;
    };
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="ElevenLabs Agents">
    To use ElevenLabs Agents as your agent provider, you'll need:

    - The agent ID from ElevenLabs of the agent you wish to use
    - [A signed URL from ElevenLabs for the chosen agent](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/agents-platform/customization/authentication#using-signed-urls)

    And then we'll use this snippet in the steps to follow:

    ```typescript
    type VoiceAgentDetails = {
      type: 'elevenlabs';
      agent_id?: '<your_eleven_agent_id>;
      signed_url?: '<your_eleven_agent_signed_url>';
    };
    ```
