Keyframe personas integrate with both agent frameworks (e.g., ElevenLabs, Cartesia) and live model APIs (e.g., Gemini Live, OpenAI Realtime). While each integration has minor setup differences, the overall flow is largely the same:

- Your client app continues to interface with your agent framework or live model API
- Keyframe's no-code or low-code components take care of relaying "raw" agent / model audio to the Keyframe platform and rendering a persona synced with said audio
