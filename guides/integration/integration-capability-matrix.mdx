Some integrations may not fully utilize the capabilities of our models.

For example, `persona-1.5-live` is designed to pair with highly expressive voice output (e.g. EvelnLabs v3). As such, if the upstream voice signal has limited prosody or emotional range, our model won't automatically render its full expressive range.
