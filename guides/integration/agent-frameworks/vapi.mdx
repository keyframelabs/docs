## Prerequisites

To use Vapi as your agent provider, you'll need:

- The assistant ID from Vapi of the assistant you wish to use
- [A signed URL from Vapi for the chosen assistant](https://docs.vapi.ai/calls/websocket-transport#creating-a-websocket-call)

### Prepare your Vapi agent provider details

Now that you have your agent details, take a note of the following snippet:

```typescript
type VoiceAgentDetails = {
  type: 'vapi';
  agent_id?: '<your_vapi_assistant_id>';
  signed_url?: '<your_vapi_assistant_signed_url>';
};
```

We'll be using this snippet in the steps to follow.
