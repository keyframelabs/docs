## Prerequisites

- The agent ID from ElevenLabs of the agent you wish to use
- [A signed URL from ElevenLabs for the chosen agent](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/agents-platform/customization/authentication#using-signed-urls)

### Prepare your ElevenLabs agent provider details

Now that you have your agent details, take a note of the following snippet:

```typescript
type VoiceAgentDetails = {
  type: 'elevenlabs';
  agent_id?: '<your_eleven_agent_id>';
  signed_url?: '<your_eleven_agent_signed_url>';
};
```

We'll be using this snippet in the steps to follow.
