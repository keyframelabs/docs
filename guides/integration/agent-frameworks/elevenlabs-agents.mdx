## Prerequisites

- The agent ID from ElevenLabs you wish to use as your agent
- [A signed URL from ElevenLabs for the chosen agent](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/agents-platform/customization/authentication#using-signed-urls)

## Your provider details

Now that you have your agent details, take a note of the following snippet:

```typescript
type VoiceAgentDetails = {
  type: 'elevenlabs';
  agent_id?: '<your_eleven_agent_id>;
  signed_url?: '<your_eleven_agent_signed_url>';
};
```
